# Twitter Map

This is an Android application that displays tweets on a Google map. The app makes real-time requests to the Twitter server and listens for tweets that contain location information. The tweets are displayed on the map by placing a pin for each tweet. The maximum number of pins that will be displayed on the map at any given time is 25. Once the maximum number of pins is reached, the oldest tweets will start to disappear from the map.
